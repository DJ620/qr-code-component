## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This is my first code challenge with [FrontendMentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io), and it was a great way to figure out how the platform works. Even though this particular challenge was faily simple, I decided to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as I want to get as comofortable as possible using these particular tools.

An interesting thing I learned about Tailwind through this challenge was that it allows you to put custom values directly into some of their utility classes, which was very helpful when I needed a specific height for an element that didn't correspond with the existing classes Tailwind offers.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div className="w-80 h-[497px] bg-white rounded-2xl p-4 text-center shadow-sm">
```
In the above code, where I have h-[497px], what this is doing is telling Tailwind I want the height to be whatever value I put in the square brackets. Very cool!
